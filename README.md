# Human–LLM Collaborative Decision Framework for Manufacturing Disruption Management

This repository contains the experimental code used in the paper:

**Human–LLM Collaborative Decision-Making for Manufacturing Disruption Management in Industry 5.0**

The code implements a human-centered decision-support framework integrating:
- Predictive analytics
- Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM)
- Large Language Model (LLM)–based reasoning for explanation

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for synthetic and real-world experiments
- `data/`: Placeholder for datasets (see notes below)
- `results/`: Generated outputs and summaries

## Datasets
- Synthetic disruption scenarios are generated programmatically.
- Real-world evaluation uses the **AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset**, which must be downloaded separately due to licensing constraints.
